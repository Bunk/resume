Dear HR Manager,

This application is in interest regarding to your Sr. Developer Experience Engineer opening on your Careers page.  As an alumni of Georgia Tech, and with my track record of delivering consistent value to customers and developers alike, I'm confident that I can bring that same value to your organization.

I absolutely love technology and the pursuit of ever simpler solutions to difficult software problems, and while I tend to be a full stack developer I am particularly drawn to process and automation.  In the past I've enjoyed the challenge of stepping out of my comfort zone to learn and hone new languages and skills, which has brought value to every company I've had to pleasure of working with.

In particular, these are a few projects and roles I'd like to highlight that I feel match perfectly with the position:
* Mobot — The LeanKit mobile squad's continuous delivery ChatOps bot — https://github.com/LeanKit-Labs/slack-mobots
* Bucko — The LeanKit automation engineer's tag-and-release bot for our micro-services — https://github.com/Bunk/ae-bucko-public
* bebe — NC2's automated delivery pipeline interface bot
* Responsible for the mobile squad's deployments and ongoing service health as a DevOps engineer
* Architected and implemented the LeanKit push notification infrastructure

Working at LeanKit, a leader in the Lean process space, has taught me many things about software delivery and workflow that I believe would translate very well to GitHub.  Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to speaking with you!

Sincerely,
JD Courtoy
