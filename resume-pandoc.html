<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I'm passionate about software development and seek to work with other like-minded polyglots who know how to use the right tool for the job at hand. I'm driven to find the simplest solution to software problems that drive customer value, and am a life-long, continuous student of the industry. I love to work in architecture, design, and development of large- and small-scale systems; and build the teams and environments that make great things happen.</p>
