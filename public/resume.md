### Summary

Samurai are servant warriors known for their virtueâ€”which is my mindset
approaching software development. I have a passion for solving
complicated problems using the simplest possible solution, and seek to
work with other like-minded polyglots who utilize the right tools for
the job at hand. I strive to humbly delight consumers of my work, and am
a life-long, continuous student of the software development community.
